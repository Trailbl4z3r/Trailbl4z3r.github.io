### Alternate Reality Game (ARG)

I used to be a really active ARG player and also a [former moderator](https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Meta:Staff) of [Game Detectives](https://wiki.gamedetectives.net) Discord. (The only Night-Time Moderator due to timezone difference with other members) Participated in a few big-scale ARGs : 
- [Sombra ARG](https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Sombra_ARG)
- [Eye Sigil ARG](https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Eye_Sigil_ARG)
- [MonteCrypto](https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=MonteCrypto)
- [Waking Titan](https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Waking_Titan)

Gained experience of playing with puzzles and cipher that also cultivated my own curiosity and interest into the world of Cybersecurity.

### Capture-the-Flag (CTF)

Started participating in CTF competitions in 2018. The first local CTF competition I participated is F-SECURE Inter-varsity Cyber Security Competition 2019. Since then, I've learnt many different skills in cryptography, steganography, forensics, and web. I also met many talented people and have the chances to learn from them. Right now, I am one of the member of team [_SKR](https://ctftime.org/team/67702) on CTFTIME and still actively participating in CTFs.

One of my aims is to host my own CTF competition in TAR UC. It will serves as an encouragement other students to be more proactive in these competition. Moreover, If I did it, it will be the first CTF competition held in TAR UC. (Update: COVID-19)
